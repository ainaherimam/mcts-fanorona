# Fanorona with MCTS

Welcome to **Fanorona with MCTS**, a project that implements the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm for the traditional board game of Fanorona.

## 📖 About Fanorona
Fanorona is a centuries-old strategy board game originating from Madagascar. It is played on a 9x5 grid (fanorona 9) or a 5x5 grid (fanorona 5)  and challenges players to capture their opponent's pieces using a variety of strategic moves. The game is renowned for its depth and complexity, making it an excellent candidate for AI research.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Implement a simple interface for 
- Implement the **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** algorithm to play Fanorona.
- Develop an AI capable of making intelligent, adaptive decisions.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Fanorona Game Logic**: The game board is represented programmatically, supporting all valid moves and captures.
- **MCTS Algorithm**: To calculate optimal moves.

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Play against the AI (simulate AI vs. AI matches)
